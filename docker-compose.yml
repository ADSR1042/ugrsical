# you need put this file in your drone exec machine, and edit .drone.yml which command is `cd /app/ugrsicalsrv`,
# so you need `mkdir /app/ugrsicalsrv` in this machine, and put this file in this directory.
# don't forget to `mkdir configs` in this dir, and put your server.json and config.json in here, which will bind mount to docker container.
